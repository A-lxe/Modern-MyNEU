# Modern-MyNEU
Open-source browser plugin that takes apart Northeastern's MyNEU portal for a much cleaner, modern look.

## Installation
The current Chrome Webstore version can be found [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/modern-myneu/phpjhjbppfdgofldhpecojjdfccboblk)

### Prerequisites
Most everything is already included here for you. The only two things you will need are:
* A viable text editing environment with a JavaScript minifying plugin. I recommend [Atom](https://atom.io/) for editing/writing code and [Minify](https://atom.io/packages/atom-minify)
* [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/install) - You need this to compile `.scss` stylesheets into usable `.css`
